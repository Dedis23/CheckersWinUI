Implementing user interface with graphic information:
Our game form graphics consists out of checkers pieces pictures (PNG) that we have found on the website OpenGameArt.org. 
We load the pictures from resources in the assmebly file. the pieces will be put in the right place on board and according to the player's type.
In addition to the pieces we used some basic colors that are in C# to color the board frame.
Moreover, we have added a dedicated button to forfeit and a new label that will indicate which turn it is, (black or white) at the bottom of the frame.
Finally, we used a timer object to control to flow of the game and to make the AI turn more realistic. 
This way the computer moves will not be too fast, and it will be easier for the user to see them.
